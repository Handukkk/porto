## 📂 Projects

### 1. [HandukLang](https://github.com/Handukkk/HandukLang)  
🛠️ A custom interpreted programming language I built for fun and exploration.  
Through this project, I learned how to:  
- Build a **lexer** to tokenize source code  
- Implement a **parser** to analyze structure  
- Construct and evaluate an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**  
- Design a simple interpreted language in **C**

### 2. [FileChat](https://github.com/Handukkk/filechat)  
💬 A **command-line multi-user chat app** that runs in Windows CMD.  
Instead of using a server, it relies on a **shared file** as the intermediary for message exchange.  
Key learnings:  
- **Multithreading** for handling multiple clients  
- File-based real-time communication  
- Windows Console API for text-based UI

### 3. [E-Commerce (Secure Programming Project)](https://github.com/Handukkk/e-commerce)  
📦 A secure e-commerce platform built with **Laravel** as part of a team project.  
Focused not only on functionality but also on **security-first coding**.  
Highlights:  
- Applied **secure coding practices** in Laravel  
- Integrated **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** for automated code scanning  
- Hands-on collaboration with Git, branching, and pull requests

## 📝 Writeups & Reports

I also maintain **security writeups, analysis, and documentation** in my portfolio.  
You can browse them in the **[Writeups](https://github.com/Handukkk/porto/tree/main/Writeups)** folder.  
These include capture-the-flag (CTF) challenge solutions, HackTheBox, and VulnHub.
